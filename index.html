            <h3>Insights about the Data & Visualization</h3>
            <p>
                This visualization is communicating trends in new Covid-19 cases measured via 
                7-day case averages between January 2020 and January 2022. It uses a spiral, that expands outwards with lines representing years and radii representing months. An 
                conflating and contracting red area depicts 7-day case averages.
            </p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Between December 2020 and February 2021, the 7-day case average expands significantly.</li>
                <li>The lowest recorded case average appears in July, followed by an increase from August to November.</li>
                <li>The January 2022 section suggests exponential growth, indicating a surge.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
                Non-linear depictions of time challenge traditional Western notions of temporality 
                as something that moves forward. Many cultures do not perceive the past as 
                something gone by, nor the present as a uniform intermediary between past and 
                future. Johan Cilliers, discussing African notions of time, suggests that
                "perhaps the image of a spiral best depicts what Africans understand as time—a spiral 
                that includes both linear and cyclical dimensions, reflecting the rhythms of life."
                Indigenous scholars like Maylei Blackwell and Mykaela Saunders have explored how 
                Western conceptions of linear time contain gendered and racialized assumptions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Given my own cultural perspective, from which I have typically viewed time as a line, I 
                recognize my positionality when interpreting non-linear temporal visualizations.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                This visual was published at the height of the pandemic, during a time of mass 
                disinformation. While non-linear depictions can offer new perspectives, clarity 
                and accessibility should take precedence when communicating public health threats. 
                This does not necessarily mean time should be depicted as a line, but rather that 
                the design choices should enhance, rather than obscure, the message.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Three Primary Critiques</h3>
        
            <h4>1. Confusing Encoding of Time</h4>
            <p>
                The encoding of months as radii in the spiral was not immediately apparent. The lack 
                of symmetry in the spiral was distracting and initially led me to misinterpret radii lengths as 
                having significance. A more symmetrical circle with equal-length radii and 
                clearer month labels (or color-coded seasons) could improve temporal orientation.
            </p>
        
            <h4>2. Unclear Data Gaps and Testing Limitations</h4>
            <p>
                The metric displayed is labeled as "New Covid-19 Cases," yet the visualization 
                does not account for gaps in data. For example, the January 2020 spiral appears 
                very small, which might imply low case rates, but the reality was a lack of 
                widespread testing. This missing data should be better communicated to not miscommunicate historic cases.
            </p>
        
            <h4>3. Lack of Human Impact and Context</h4>
            <p>
                The "stakes" of the visualization remain unclear. While fluctuations in case 
                loads are visible, the personal and systemic consequences are not. Each pink blip in the visual
                represents thousands of lives lost. I look at this and think: When did my local hospital become full? 
                When did triaging care start to happen? When did the refrigerated truck 
                morgues that I would walk by appear in Central Park? Numbers hide stories of personal and collective loss, and a more human-centered approach could make this clearer.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Refining the "So What?"</h3>
            <p>
                The article suggests that the key takeaway is:  
                    "Our models project that the United States is likely to document more Covid-19 
                    cases in January than in any previous month of the pandemic, but a smaller fraction 
                    of those cases will require hospitalization."
                However, the visualization focuses on the past rather than helping the reader 
                understand the future impact. If January 2022 is a projection rather than 
                historical data, that distinction should be emphasized in the legend. Additionally, 
                the uncertainty around COVID-19 projections overall that is conveyed in the text should be more explicitly visualized.
