            <h3>Insights about the Data & Visualization</h3>
            <p>
                This visualization is communicating trends in new Covid-19 cases measured via 
                7-day case averages between January 2020 and January 2022. It uses a spiral, that expands outwards with lines representing years and radii representing months. An 
                conflating and contracting red area depicts 7-day case averages.
            </p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Between December 2020 and February 2021, the 7-day case average expands significantly.</li>
                <li>The lowest recorded case average appears in July, followed by an increase from August to November.</li>
                <li>The January 2022 section suggests exponential growth, indicating a surge.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
                Non-linear depictions of time challenge traditional Western notions of temporality 
                as something that moves forward. Many cultures do not perceive the past as 
                something gone by, nor the present as a uniform intermediary between past and 
                future. Johan Cilliers, discussing African notions of time, suggests that
                "perhaps the image of a spiral best depicts what Africans understand as time—a spiral 
                that includes both linear and cyclical dimensions, reflecting the rhythms of life."
                Indigenous scholars like Maylei Blackwell and Mykaela Saunders have explored how 
                Western conceptions of linear time contain gendered and racialized assumptions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Given my own cultural perspective, from which I have typically viewed time as a line, I 
                recognize my positionality when interpreting non-linear temporal visualizations.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                This visual was published at the height of the pandemic, during a time of mass 
                disinformation. While non-linear depictions can offer new perspectives, clarity 
                and accessibility should take precedence when communicating public health threats. 
                This does not necessarily mean time should be depicted as a line, but rather that 
                the design choices should enhance, rather than obscure, the message.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Three Primary Critiques</h3>
        
            <h4>1. Confusing Encoding of Time</h4>
            <p>
                The encoding of months as radii in the spiral was not immediately apparent. The lack 
                of symmetry in the spiral was distracting and initially led me to misinterpret radii lengths as 
                having significance. A more symmetrical circle with equal-length radii and 
                clearer month labels (or color-coded seasons) could improve temporal orientation.
            </p>
        
            <h4>2. Unclear Data Gaps and Testing Limitations</h4>
            <p>
                The metric displayed is labeled as "New Covid-19 Cases," yet the visualization 
                does not account for gaps in data. For example, the January 2020 spiral appears 
                very small, which might imply low case rates, but the reality was a lack of 
                widespread testing. This missing data should be better communicated to not miscommunicate historic cases.
            </p>
        
            <h4>3. Lack of Human Impact and Context</h4>
            <p>
                The "stakes" of the visualization remain unclear. While fluctuations in case 
                loads are visible, the personal and systemic consequences are not. Each pink blip in the visual
                represents thousands of lives lost. I look at this and think: When did my local hospital become full? 
                When did triaging care start to happen? When did the refrigerated truck 
                morgues that I would walk by appear in Central Park? Numbers hide stories of personal and collective loss, and a more human-centered approach could make this clearer.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Refining the "So What?"</h3>
            <p>
                The article suggests that the key takeaway is:  
                    "Our models project that the United States is likely to document more Covid-19 
                    cases in January than in any previous month of the pandemic, but a smaller fraction 
                    of those cases will require hospitalization."
                However, the visualization focuses on the past rather than helping the reader 
                understand the future impact. If January 2022 is a projection rather than 
                historical data, that distinction should be emphasized in the legend. Additionally, 
                the uncertainty around COVID-19 projections overall that is conveyed in the text should be more explicitly visualized.

			</figure>
            <p><strong>Design Rationale for Sketch 1:</strong></p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Maintaining the Depiction of Continuous Time</strong>  
                    In this visual, I wanted to maintain the depiction of time as continuous, so I chose a gradient bar shaped to evoke circular motion. While I considered overlapping circles or concentric rings to represent each year, I realized a limitation of those graphics would be the visual separation between the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, as well as between the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. When thinking about illness, people often associate sickness with specific seasons rather than calendar years, so I aimed to preserve the more human experience of time, specifically "Covid time", that was present in the original graphic’s use of a spiral.
                    <ul>
                        <li>By maintaining continuity, I wanted this graphic to reflect how people remember and experience pandemics as ongoing rather than confined to calendar years.</li>
                        <li>I first considered using overlapping circles or concentric rings to represent each year, but that would have introduced breaks between years. I realized that these decisions could misrepresent the way choices made at the end of one year impact outcomes in the beginning of another.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            
                <li><strong>Curving the Bar for Aesthetic and Symbolic Purposes</strong>  
                    The choice to curve the bar was more aesthetic and symbolic rather than functional. I like how curving it still challenges notions of linear time and makes the visual engaging. However, placing and reading labels along curvilinear shapes can be challenging.
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's harder to place labels along curved shapes, making it difficult to track specific points along the timeline.</li>
                        <li>While the spiral in the original graphic was employed to convey the passage of time (and had functional elements, like the radii, to do so), my curved bar lacks a clear function.</li>
                        <li>The unintended “board game” aesthetic makes the data feel less serious than it is.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            
                <li><strong>Using a Gradient for New Case Rates</strong>  
                    I chose a gradient to represent new case rates because I wondered if one reason the original graphic was distracting was that reading variations in the thickness of the spiral’s area felt a bit unintuitive. Reading colors, especially along a traditional cold-hot continuum, feels more immediate. While I find color more effective, my specific color choices (limited by my pen collection) are too bright and childish to effectively communicate this data. I also recognize the need to communicate “stakes” more clearly and wonder if the width of the bar could be used to depict hospital capacity or another metric.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color can be processed more intuitively than thickness changes, making it easier to compare rates at a glance.</li>
                        <li>Using a cold-hot color scale (e.g., blue to red) might make trends more readable and evoke a feeling of urgency.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            
                <li><strong>Including the Omicron Variant Label</strong>  
                    I included a label for the Omicron variant since that was the focus of the article in which this graphic appeared. Additionally, I chose to extend the graphic to the end of the page to indicate that this phase of the pandemic is ongoing.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Omicron label provides context and helps connect the graphic to the article’s main topic. I wonder if further labeling of other key events could also add helpful context.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            
                <li><strong>Reflections on the Design Process</strong>  
                    Overall, developing this graphic made me appreciate the role of continuous time depictions and helped me better understand the original thinking behind the spiral design. However, in this version, I dislike the non-functional role of the curvature. In my next drawing, I am curious to explore another way to depict continuous time and think more about integrating narrative around what is at stake.

            <p><strong>Design Rationale for Sketch 2:</strong></p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Flattening the Timeline</strong>  
                    In this visual, I experimented with flattening the timeline to run along a traditional line chart, with months and years running continuously along the x-axis and new cases on the y-axis. A secondary x-axis label indicates the break between years, but that break isn’t visible in the chart area itself.
                    <ul>
                        <li>While I see a trade-off between clarity of temporal communication and engaging the reader with time in a different way (through a non-linear depiction), working on this drawing made me recognize that the priority is showing the continuity of time, and that can be accomplished on a line graph through the axis.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            
                <li><strong>Incorporating a Call to Action</strong>  
                    I wanted to think more about the "call to action" that this graphic, as the leading one in the article, could pose to the reader. Since the piece is about future Omicron projections and mentions the inherent uncertainty of projecting forward, I wondered what effect showing the future 2022 data as a series of dotted lines—representing a future not set in stone but capable of being changed (similar to some of the “flatten the curve” charts) could have on someone looking to immediately understand the article’s takeaway.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Showing more of the 2022 data may achieve the goal of prompting viewers to think more deeply about their own actions, but it also inadvertantly communicates a sense of uncertainty.</li>
                        <li>I wonder if this uncertainty may be counterintuitive to the goal of the article, which is to communicate urgency about the need to remain vigilant with protective measures even two years into the pandemic.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            
                <li><strong>Grounding the Data with Pandemic Landmarks</strong>  
                    As I mentioned above, looking at Covid-19 data can be disorienting and strange given the recency of our own personal and collective memories of it. I wanted to add labels to ground this data in time by pointing out landmark moments in the pandemic to serve as an acknowledgment of all that has been lost. At the end of 2021, life was somewhat returning to normal in the sense that colleges were welcoming students back, and the vaccine was widely available in the U.S. There was a widespread desire to resume normal life, and I wanted to experiment with textual callouts to remind viewers that the crisis was still ongoing.
                    <ul>
                        <li>However, I wonder if the labels themselves might be a distraction from the goal of this piece, which is not about specific milestones but about learning from past trends in case loads to predict future surges.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            
                <li><strong>Balancing Non-Linearity with Continuity</strong>  
                    Developing this drawing clarified for me that the element of the spiral I wanted to preserve was not its non-linearity but its ability to communicate the ongoing nature of time. While I was thinking more about presenting a full story in this one graphic, I also recognize that showing potential future scenarios alongside textual labels of past pandemic milestones may be counterproductive. Using dotted lines for future scenarios can reduce the sense of "realness" surrounding the actual unfolding emergency unless the lines themselves are very clearly labeled as separate scenarios.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reflections on the Design Process</strong>  
                    In my next drawing, I am curious to take a more elegant approach and think more about what the essential information to communicate is. I want to build off of the line graph format in this chart, and improve the "call to action" component.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Design Rationale for Sketch 3:</strong></p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Unfolding Narrative as a Communication Tool</strong>  
                    For this visual, I was thinking again about time and how it is communicated, as well as the "unfolding" nature of historic events like the pandemic. I wondered how subtle visual choices could encapsulate the feeling of living through a pandemic. Using the same base graphic format as before, I folded my paper, with each fold representing a year. The viewer can unfold it and see at the end that projected cases will potentially exceed any past surge. In a digital format, I can see this being a graphic where you scroll horizontally or scroll vertically to reveal additional horizontal panels.
                    <ul>
                        <li>I tried to balance communicating the unknowability of the future with not overemphasizing uncertainty, as I did in the last graphic. I think revealing the graphic in parts accomplishes this emotionally.</li>
                        <li>I recognize that there are trade-offs with interactive graphics. They are harder to share and can be confusing for a reader skimming a piece. I am curious to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of interactive versus static visuals in future classes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            
                <li><strong>Simplifying Information Communicated</strong>  
                    In addition to removing multiple future scenario dotted lines and leaving just one, I also removed the historic event markers and simplified the x-axis to focus on the upcoming Omicron surge and eliminate visual distractions.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The chart looks a little barren with only the thin line representing Covid case rates.</li>
                        <li>I wonder if I simplified it too much. Using different colors or turning this into a bar or area chart could be a more effective way to integrate additional dimensions of data, such as deaths or healthcare system capacity.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            
                <li><strong>Asterisk at 0</strong>  
                    I realized that in my past drawings, I had not addressed the issue of early 2020 data being misleading due to the lack of widespread testing. In this drawing, I added a small asterisk to the 0 on the y-axis, accompanied by a note stating:  
                        "This data is based on reported cases and is likely an undercount of actual cases. Case rates in early 2020 are likely inaccurate because testing was not widely available at the time."
                    <ul>
                        <li>Communicating missing data is essential, and this was missing from the original graphic.</li>
                        <li>While I considered visual ways to represent missing data, I felt that since this was not the primary focus of the graphic, text was the most effective and least distracting way to convey it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            
                <li><strong>Future Considerations</strong>  
                    In my next visual, I want to emphasize that behind each data point is a human life. I think this could be important for reinforcing the "so what" at the end of the graphic.
                </li>

                <h2>Data Displayed and Transformations</h2>
                <p>
                    The data displayed is from the Google Covid-19 Open Data. In this visual, I used the data fields 
                    <strong>“New Confirmed”</strong> to depict new Covid cases and <strong>“New Deceased”</strong> to depict lives lost 
                    as a result of Covid. For both of these metrics, I summed them at the weekly temporal scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I removed any data beyond January 2022 to stay aligned with the original visualization, which only depicts data up to that point.
                </p>
            
                <h2>Visual Encodings</h2>
            
                <h3>Bar Chart</h3>
                <p>
                    I used a bar chart in this graphic. The <strong>x-axis</strong> represents time, covering 25 months from January 2020 to January 2022. 
                    I used a continuous time scale to avoid visual breaks that would artificially impose the calendar year onto the data. The <strong>y-axis</strong> 
                    shows weekly new reported cases, starting at 0 and going up to 5.5 million, with intervals of 500,000.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each bar represents discrete weekly case counts over the two years of data I am depicting. While experimenting with bars, lines, and 
                    area charts, I found that the discreteness of bars made it easiest for users to see individual surges.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Color Encoding for Deaths</h3>
                <p>
                    The color of the bars represents the number of weekly deaths, using a gradient that starts with pale pink and shifts to dark red for 
                    higher death counts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adding color to the bar chart allows for an intuitive connection between rising case numbers and lives lost.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Chart Labels</h3>
                <p>
                    I added a reference line to represent median weekly cases and shaded the area above it to highlight how extreme past and ongoing 
                    surges have been.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I included a small label at the top of the chart to mark the <strong>Omicron variant</strong>, drawing attention to the right side of the graph 
                    and helping viewers interpret the large spike in cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also added a footnote in the blank space near early 2020 to note that case numbers from that period were likely underreported due 
                    to a lack of widespread testing. I placed the text in the blank space to emphasize the <strong>"missing"</strong> data values.

                <p>
                    The <strong>bolded text below the x-axis</strong> labels highlights the human loss behind the abstract data: 
                    "Behind each data point is a person." This direct message creates a moment of reflection and humanization.

                <h2>What Works</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>People are much better at reading the length of bars than interpreting the size of circles (or other non-bar shapes). Because of this, I chose bars over other visual forms and think they are more effective at communicating changes in case rates than the original spiral diagram, where the thickness of the spiral was harder to read.</li>
                    <li>Encoding case rates alongside deaths immediately raises the stakes. Especially at the time this article was published, reminding people of the immense human toll of the virus may have been emotionally difficult, but it also serves as a reminder of the urgency of taking protective measures.</li>
                    <li>Labeling the Omicron surge helps direct attention to the article's main focus and makes the data align more directly with the story being told in the text.</li>
                    <li>Using text to call out missing data and emphasize the people behind each data point adds nuance and reinforces the "so what" behind this visualization.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>Limitations and Critiques</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The color encoding of deaths may not be immediately clear and requires looking at the legend, which is a bit too small.</li>
                    <li>While the note about early 2020 cases helps communicate uncertainty, the ongoing uncertainty around the 2022 surge could be better conveyed using visual elements like dotted bars or different colors.</li>
                    <li>The visualization does not communicate the inequitable impacts of the pandemic. Without data showing which communities or socioeconomic groups were most affected, it is difficult to highlight the need for racial and social-equity centered policies and interventions.</li>
                </ul>

      <h2>How Does My Final Design Address (or not) My Critiques from Step 2?</h2>

      <p>
        My three critiques were that 1) the visual encoding of time was unclear and confusing, 2) there was a lack of communication about why early pandemic COVID rates were so low, and 3) the stakes of the visual were unclear and lacked connection to the goals of the article itself, which were about the impending Omicron variant surge.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        My design sought to address the first critique by flattening the timeline into a continuous line format, keeping the communication of calendar years as a continuous phenomenon while removing the difficult-to-read radii and spiral formation. I still wonder about ways to maintain the spiral or display time in a creative, non-linear, continuous format that is legible. I am also interested in learning about different data visualization tools that allow for more flexibility than Tableau.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I sought to address the second critique by adding a textual note in the blank space where “missing” cases appear in early 2020. I think this is effective at communicating uncertainty, though maybe additional text before or after the chart could add more context about the limits of reported case data and why it is still a useful metric.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        For the third critique, I addressed this in three ways. First, I added a small label “Omicron Variant” and an arrow drawing attention to the recent surge. Second, I included a textual comment below the chart referencing the human lives behind the data. Third, I visually encoded weekly deaths from COVID in the bars through color. I think what is still missing is the social equity angle because I believe that treating data as a tool for racial, gender, and economic justice means finding ways to bring these dimensions into visualizations.
